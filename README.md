# SvelteKanban

This is a personal Kanban done in Svelte. Ultimately to be a part of ScriptPad. But, 
currently a standalone project showing how to use different technologies with Svelte. 

Just run:

```sh
npm init
npm run dev
```

And a development server will open running the project on Http://localhost:5000.

This version doesn't save information. It is a testing platform for my full version 
will be a part of ScriptPad (my larger project, but is similar to my https://github.com/raguay/NotePad 
project done in the Mint language. ScriptPad is a larger, Svelte project that works similarly).

If you want to contribute, just send a pull request. Thanks.
