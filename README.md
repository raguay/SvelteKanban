# SvelteKanban

This is a personal Kanban done in Svelte. Ultimately to be a part of ScriptPad. But, 
currently a standalone project showing how to use different technologies with Svelte. 

Just run:

```sh
npm init
npm run dev
```

And a development server will open running the project on Http://localhost:5000.
